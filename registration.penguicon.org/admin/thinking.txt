What's the difference between "add a payment", "apply a payment", and "process a completed order"?

Process a completed order:
* Locate the items that were paid for
* Put them in the appropriate table
* Send a confirmation email, if necessary
* Mark order as processed
* Mark payment as applied

Add a payment:
* Put the payment into the database.
